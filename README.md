# Main Work
## MADO
Jul 2024 - Present

[MADO (Minimalistic Application Display Orchestrator)](https://github.com/sysprog21/mado) is an open-source library that brings advanced window system features to smaller devices.

In this project, my role is that of a reviewer for numerical analysis, such as the polynomial approximation of fixed points for the sine function and improvements to fixed point BÃ©zier curves. Additionally, I am also attempting to introduce SDL2 to replace the code that depends on Xlib.

Features:
  fixed-point arithmetic

## Time-fractional Allen-Cahn Eqaution Solver
Feb 2023 - Aug 2023

[TfAC_solver](https://github.com/jouae/TfAC_solver) An implement that solves the Allen-Cahn equation with respect to fractional derivatives in time.

$$
{}_CD_t^{\alpha} u = \epsilon^2 \Delta u -W'(u)
$$

where $\displaystyle {}_CD_t^{\alpha} u=\int_0^t \frac{(t-s)^{\alpha}}{\Gamma{(1-\alpha)}}u'(s)d$ represents the Caputo derivative with respect to time for $u$.
