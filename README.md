## Time-fractional Allen-Cahn Eqaution Solver
[TfAC_solver](https://github.com/jouae/TfAC_solver) An implement that solves the Allen-Cahn equation with respect to fractional derivatives in time.

$$
{}_CD_t^{\alpha} u = \epsilon^2 \Delta u -W'(u)
$$

where $\displaystyle {}_CD_t^{\alpha} u=\int_0^t \frac{(t-s)^{\alpha}}{\Gamma{(1-\alpha)}}u'(s)d$ represents the Caputo derivative with respect to time for $u$.
